This is a [showoff](http://github.com/schacon/showoff) presentation. To get it running locally:

    gem install showoff
    git clone git://github.com/bflad/presentation-chef-in-the-woods.git
    cd presentation-chef-in-the-woods
    showoff serve

Or, you can run it via rack (e.g., using Passenger) by just installing the showoff gem and pointing to the rackup file (config.ru).
